## üöÄ How to Use

Because this application requires microphone access, you must serve it from a local web server. The easiest way to do this is with the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
-   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one for free from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension installed.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository or Download the File:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    Or, simply download the `DictationApp.html` file.

2.  **Add Your API Key:**
    -   Open `DictationApp.html` in a text editor like VS Code.
    -   Find the following line in the `<script>` section:
        ```javascript
        const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
        ```
    -   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Google Gemini API key.

3.  **Launch with Live Server:**
    -   Right-click the `DictationApp.html` file inside VS Code.
    -   Select "**Open with Live Server**".
    -   Your browser will automatically open with the application running.

4.  **Start Recording:**
    -   The browser will ask for microphone permission when the page loads. Click **Allow**.
    -   Select your desired microphone from the dropdown.
    -   Click the red microphone button to start and stop recording!
