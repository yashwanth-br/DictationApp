AI Voice Notes: Real-time Dictation and Smart Note-Taking
This is a sophisticated web-based dictation application that goes beyond simple transcription. It uses the browser's native speech recognition alongside the Gemini API to not only transcribe your speech in real time but also clean and polish it into a well-structured, professional note using Markdown. The app's animated and responsive design provides a smooth and intuitive user experience.
